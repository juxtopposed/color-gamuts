## Color Gamut Test

Color Gamut Test is a simple web application designed to test the color gamut of your display. The more colors you see, the wider your display's color gamut.

## What is [Color Gamut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamut)?

In color reproduction and colorimetry, a gamut, or color gamut /ˈɡæmət/, is a convex set containing the colors that can be accurately represented, i.e. reproduced by an output device (e.g. printer or display) or measured by an input device (e.g. camera or visual system). Devices with a larger gamut can represent more colors. Similarly, gamut may also refer to the colors within a defined color space, which is not linked to a specific device. A trichromatic gamut is often visualized as a color triangle. A less common usage defines gamut as the subset of colors contained within an image, scene or video.
